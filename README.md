This repository contains the analysis code for _Behavioral control through the direct, focal silencing of neuronal activity_ by Elleman _et. al_, 2024

**Figure 4: Avctivation of STX-pbc 13 abolishes action potentials in layer 4 cortical neurons** 

Igor Pro scripts were used for AP detection and analysis of AP waveform . R scripts were use for statistical analysis and creation of plots. 

The Igor Pro scripts contain a functions to import .abf files written by JS Rothman Rothman JS and Silver RA.

`Figure_4_AP_count.ipf` was used to count in the number of APs in different experimental conditions. **A - B**

`Figure_4_AP_phase_plane.ipf` was used to generate the phase plane plot.**C**

`Figure_4_AP_characteristics.ipf` contains functions used to analyze the AP waveform, and export example traces. **D - J, M**

`Figure_4_AP_raster.ipf` was used to create an action potential raster plot.**K - M**
